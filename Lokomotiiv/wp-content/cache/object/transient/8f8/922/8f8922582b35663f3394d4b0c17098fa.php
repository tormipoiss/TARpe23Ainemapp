<p>Making great software, great product that stands the test of time and not just survives but thrives through monumental technological shifts is <em>incredibly hard</em>. That challenge is part of the reason I love doing it. There is never a dull day, and the reward of seeing the code you wrote used by the most amazing creators in the world is an indescribable pleasure. <strong>When I see what people create with WordPress, some days I feel like I‚Äôm grinding pigment for Leonardo da Vinci or slitting a quill for Beethoven.</strong></p>



<p>In open source, one thing that makes it even harder to ship great software is bringing together disparate groups of contributors who may have entirely different incentives or missions or philosophies about how to make great work. Working together on a team is such a delicate balance, and even one person rowing in the wrong direction can throw everyone else off.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs why periodically I think it is very healthy for open source projects to fork, it allows for people to try out and experiment with different forms of governance, leadership, decision-making, and technical approaches. As I&#8217;ve said, forking is beautiful, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/">forks have my full support and we&#8217;ll even link and promote them</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://joost.blog/">Joost</a> is a self-proclaimed leader in the SEO space, an industry known for making the web better. He asked for and <a href="https://joost.blog/leading-marketing-communication-for-wordpress/">I gave him WordPress marketing leadership responsibility</a> in January 2019 and <a href="https://joost.blog/why-im-stepping-down-from-my-wordpress-marketing-role/">he stepped down in June of 2019</a>, I think we would both agree in those 5 months he was not effective at leading the marketing team or doing the work himself.</p>



<p><a href="https://marucchi.com/">Karim</a> leads a small WordPress agency called <a href="https://crowdfavorite.com/">Crowd Favorite</a> which counts clients such as Lexus and ABC and employs ~50 people.</p>



<p>Both are men I have shared meals with and consider of the highest integrity. I would trust them to watch any of my 15 godchildren for a day. These are good humans. Now go do the work. It probably won&#8217;t happen on day one, but Joost and Karim&#8217;s fork, which I&#8217;ll call JKPress until they come up with a better name, has a number of ideas they want to try out around governance and architecture. While Joost and Karim will be unilaterally in charge in the beginning, it sounds <a href="https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/">like they want to set up</a>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A non-profit foundation, with a broad board to control their new project.</li>



<li>A website owned by that foundation which hosts community resources like a plugin directory, forums, etc.</li>



<li>No more centralized and moderated plugin and theme directories with security guidelines or restrictions are what plugins are allowed to do like putting banners in your admin or gathering data, everything done in a federated/distributed manner.</li>



<li>The trademarks for their new project will either be public domain or held by their foundation.</li>



<li>&#8220;Modernization&#8221; of the technology stack, perhaps going a Laravel-like approach or changing how WordPress&#8217; architecture works.</li>



<li>Teams and committees to make decisions for everything, so no single person has too much power or authority.</li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://marucchi.com/wordpress-leadership-continued/">Karim has a similar post</a>. Joost says he has the time and energy to lead:</p>

I am sure plenty of people and companies are willing to help me and we&#39;ve got plenty of ideas on what we should be doing.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WordPress</a></p>&mdash; Joost de Valk (@jdevalk) <a href="https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1877731220135538728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Now, as core committer Jb Audras (not employed by me or Automattic) points out, within WordPress we have a process in which people earn the right to lead a release:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before leading any major release of WordPress, please start with leading a minor one <a href="https://twitter.com/jdevalk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jdevalk</a>.

These are the steps everyone in our community should follow before claiming to run ¬´¬†the next releases¬†¬ª.</p>&mdash; Jb Audras (@AudrasJb) <a href="https://twitter.com/AudrasJb/status/1877833087473565785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However in Joost and Karim&#8217;s new project, they don&#8217;t need to follow our process or put in the hours to prove their worth within the WordPress.org ecosystem, they can just lead by example by shipping code and product to people that they can use, evaluate, and test out for themselves. If they need financial or hosting support is sounds like WP Engine wants to support their fork:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate <a href="https://twitter.com/jdevalk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jdevalk</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/karimmarucchi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@karimmarucchi</a> thoughtful call for constructive conversation, change and evolved leadership within the WordPress community.

</div></figure>



<p>Awesome! (Maybe it&#8217;s so successful they rebrand as JK Engine in the future.) WP Engine, with its half a billion in revenue and 1,000+ employees, has more than enough resources to support and maintain a legitimate fork of WordPress. And they are welcome to use all the GPL code myself and others have created to do so, including many parts of WordPress.org that are open source released under the GPL, and Gutenberg which is GPL + MPL. </p>



<p>Joost also is a major investor (owner?) in <a href="https://poststatus.com/">Post Status</a> (which he tried to sell to me a few months ago, and I declined to buy, perhaps kicking off his consternation with me), so they have a news media site and Slack instance already ready to go. He also is an investor in <a href="https://patchstack.com/">PatchStack</a> and appears to be trying to create a new business around something called <a href="https://progressplanner.com/">Progress Planner</a>, both of which could be incorporated into the new non-profit project to give them some competitive distinctions from WordPress.</p>



<p>To make this easy and hopefully give this project the push it needs to get off the ground, I&#8217;m deactivating the .org accounts of <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/joostdevalk/">Joost</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/pirazo/">Karim</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/sereedmedia/">Se Reed</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/idea15/">Heather Burns</a>, and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mor10/">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a>. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to try different leadership models or align with WP Engine to join up with their new effort.</p>



<p>In the meantime, on top of my <a href="https://automattic.com/">day job running a 1,700+ person company with 25+ products</a>, which I typically work 60-80 hours a week on, I&#8217;ll find time on nights and weekends to work on WordPress 6.8 and beyond. Myself and other &#8220;non-sponsored&#8221; contributors have been doing this a long time and while we may need to reduce scope a bit I think we can put out a solid release in March.</p>



<p>Joost and Karim have a number of bold and interesting ideas, and I&#8217;m genuinely curious to see how they work out. The beauty of open source is they can take all of the GPL code in WordPress and ship their vision. You don&#8217;t need permission, you can just do things. If they create something that&#8217;s awesome, we may even merge it back into WordPress, that ability for code and ideas to freely flow between projects is part of what makes open source such an engine for innovation. I propose that in a year we do a WordPress + JKPress summit, look at what we&#8217;ve shipped and learned in the process, which I&#8217;d be happy to host and sponsor in NYC next January 2026. The broader community will benefit greatly from this effort, as it&#8217;s giving us a true chance to try something different and see how it goes.</p>

<p>The modern web has gradually shifted from a vibrant tapestry of personal expression to a landscape of identical designs, where millions of websites share not just similar structures, but identical visual language, spacing, and interaction patterns. As we collectively gravitate toward the same ‚Äúproven‚Äù layouts and ‚Äúconversion-optimized‚Äù designs, we‚Äôre not just losing visual diversity ‚Äì we‚Äôre ceding control over how we present ourselves to the world. This matters because genuine self-expression online isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about maintaining spaces where authentic voices can flourish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When every blog has the same hero section, when every portfolio follows the same grid, when every restaurant site looks interchangeable, we create an echo chamber of sameness. The cost isn‚Äôt just visual monotony ‚Äì it‚Äôs the slow erosion of the web‚Äôs ability to surprise, delight, and showcase truly individual perspectives. WordPress, with its emphasis on complete ownership and control, offers an opportunity to break free from this convergence of design, allowing creators to build digital spaces that truly reflect their unique voice and vision.</p>



<p>Think of WordPress themes like album covers. They should have personality and create an immediate visual impact. The web has become too sanitized, with everyone chasing the same minimal, ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù look.</p>



<p>Great themes should:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have a strong point of view ‚Äì like how Kubrick (the classic WordPress theme) defined an era with its distinctive header gradient. Don&#8217;t try to be everything to everyone.</li>



<li>Embrace specific aesthetics boldly ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs brutalist design, pixel art, hand-drawn elements, or distinctive typography. Create themes that excite people rather than just working for everyone.</li>



<li>Design for specific use cases ‚Äì like a theme for photographers that‚Äôs all about full-bleed images or a theme for writers that treats typography as art or a theme for musicians that feels like an album cover.</li>



<li>Break some rules thoughtfully ‚Äì because not every theme needs a hamburger menu. Not every theme needs to be mobile-first. Sometimes constraints create character.</li>
</ul>



<p>We need more themes that make people say ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different!‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs clean and professional.‚Äù The web needs more personality, more risk-taking, more fun.</p>



<p>After spending countless hours digging through the WordPress theme repository, searching for designs that break the mold and spark excitement, I came up nearly empty-handed. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì there are plenty of well-built themes out there. But where‚Äôs the daring? The personality? The unexpected?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve got a wild theme idea burning in your mind ‚Äì that portfolio theme that looks like a vintage trading card collection, that blog theme inspired by zine culture, that restaurant theme that feels like a hand-drawn menu ‚Äì now&#8217;s the time to build it. WordPress desperately needs your creativity, your weird ideas, your willingness to break the visual rules. The future of the web shouldn&#8217;t be a monochrome landscape of identical layouts. Let&#8217;s make WordPress themes exciting again. Let&#8217;s make the web weird again.</p>

<p>As you may have heard, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318350/automattic-restore-wp-engine-access-wordpress">I&#8217;m legally compelled to provide free labor and services to WP Engine thanks to the success of their expensive lawyers</a>, so in order to avoid bothering the court I will say that none of the above applies to WP Engine, so if they need to bypass any of the above please just have your high-priced attorneys talk to my high-priced attorneys and we&#8217;ll arrange access, or just reach out directly to me on Slack and I&#8217;ll fix things for you.</p>



<p>I hope to find the time, energy, and money to reopen all of this sometime in the new year. Right now much of the time I would spend making WordPress better is being taken up defending against WP Engine&#8217;s legal attacks. Their attacks are against Automattic, but also me individually as the owner of WordPress.org, which means if they win I can be personally liable for millions of dollars of damages.</p>



<p>If you would like to fund legal attacks against me, I would encourage you to sign up for WP Engine services, <a href="https://wpengine.com/plans/">they have great plans and pricing starting at $50/mo and scaling all the way up to $2,000/mo</a>. If not, you can use <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/wp-engine-promotions/">literally any other web host in the world that isn&#8217;t suing me and is offering promotions and discounts for switching away from WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p>On a memorable evening in Tokyo, State of the Word 2024 brought together WordPress enthusiasts from around the world‚Äîhundreds in person and millions more online. This event marked the first time State of the Word was hosted in Asia, reflecting the platform&#8217;s growing global reach. The setting couldn‚Äôt have been more fitting: a city where tradition and technology coexist in seamless harmony. Tokyo, much like WordPress itself, reflects a powerful blend of legacy and innovation, craftsmanship and technology, and moments of vast scale balanced by serene stillness.</p>

</div>



<p>During the event, the concept of <em>kansei</em> engineering emerged as a central theme. This Japanese design philosophy seeks to create experiences that go beyond function and aesthetics, focusing on how something feels. As highlighted during the keynote, this principle has quietly influenced WordPress‚Äôs development, shaping its design and user experience in ways that resonate on an instinctive level.</p>



<p>The evening also celebrated Japan‚Äôs deep-rooted connection to WordPress. Nearly 21 years ago, Japan became the first country to localize WordPress, long before a formal translation framework existed. It all started with<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed/"> a single forum post from a user named Otsukare</a>, launching a translation project that helped WordPress become a truly global platform. Seeing how far the Japanese WordPress community has come‚Äîboth in market share and cultural influence‚Äîwas a powerful reminder of what shared purpose can achieve.</p>

<p>Wapuu, WordPress‚Äôs beloved mascot, was also born in Japan. What began as a simple idea for a fun and friendly representation of WordPress evolved into a global phenomenon. Thanks to Kazuko Kaneuchi‚Äôs generous open-source contribution, Wapuu has been reimagined by WordPress communities worldwide, each version infused with local character. This uniquely Japanese creation has helped make WordPress more welcoming, approachable, and fun wherever it appears.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WordPress Growth in 2024</h2>



<p>WordPress cofounder Matt Mullenweg highlighted significant achievements that underscored WordPress‚Äôs growth, resilience, and expanding global presence in 2024. He shared that WordPress now powers 43.6% of all websites globally. In Japan, WordPress‚Äôs influence is even more pronounced, powering 58.5% of all websites. This remarkable statistic reinforces the platform‚Äôs enduring role as a cornerstone of the open web and accentuates Japan‚Äôs deep-rooted commitment to the WordPress ecosystem and its developers‚Äô significant contributions.</p>

<p>WordPress sites using languages other than English are expected to surpass English-language sites by 2025. German recently overtook Japanese as the third-most-used language, though Japanese remained close behind. Meanwhile, emerging languages like Farsi experienced rapid adoption, reflecting the platform‚Äôs expanding multilingual ecosystem. In Southeast Asia, languages such as Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Thai saw substantial year-over-year growth, signaling broader adoption across diverse regions.</p>



<p>Core downloads surged to nearly half a billion annually, with the notable releases of WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-5/">6.5</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-6/">6.6</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-7/">6.7</a>.</p>



<p>WordPress‚Äôs design and development ecosystem flourished as well. Over 1,700 new themes were uploaded in 2024, bringing more than 1,000 block themes to the official repository and reflecting increased interest in modern, flexible site design.</p>



<p>The plugin ecosystem also saw record-breaking activity this year. Plugin downloads surged toward 2.35 billion, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. Plugin updates exceeded 3 billion and are on track to surpass 3.5 billion by year‚Äôs end. Notably, the Plugin Review Team made transformative improvements, drastically reducing the average review wait time. Their efficiency gains were complemented by the launch of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/">Plugin Check</a> tool, which reduced submission issues by 41% while enabling the team to approve 138% more plugins each week.</p>



<p>These accomplishments showcase WordPress‚Äôs resilience, adaptability, and ever-expanding influence. As the platform continues to evolve, its global community remains at the heart of its success, driving innovation and ensuring that WordPress thrives as the leading tool for building the open web.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Writing</h3>



<p>The writing experience in WordPress saw notable advancements this year, with an improved distraction-free mode that helps users to focus on content creation without interface distractions. Now you can directly select the image itself to drag and drop it where you want, even enabling on-the-fly gallery creation when you drop images next to each other.</p>



<p>Additionally, the introduction of block-level comments in the editor, currently an experimental feature, promises to reshape collaborative workflows by enabling teams to leave notes directly on blocks.</p>



<p>These enhancements all work together to make writing, composing, and editing in WordPress feel more fluid, personal, and pleasant than ever.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Design</h3>



<p>Along with new default theme Twenty Twenty-Five, more than 1,000 block themes offer tailored starting points for different site types, including portfolios, blogs, and business sites. Designers can also utilize the improved Style Book for a comprehensive view of their site‚Äôs appearance, ensuring a smooth design process.</p>



<p>Design work isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs also about creating the right environment and guardrails. It‚Äôs important that users can interact with their site, add content, replace media, and choose sections without needing to know the layout details. We‚Äôre implementing better default experiences to help you focus exclusively on the content or on the design, depending on your needs at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all works seamlessly with the zoom-out view, where users can compose content using patterns without having to set up every individual block. Having a bird‚Äôs-eye view of your site can really help you gain a different perspective.</p>



<p>These design capabilities scale with you as your WordPress projects grow. WordPress&#8217;s approach to design is systematic: blocks combine to form patterns, patterns form templates, and templates help separate content from presentation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Building</h3>



<p>WordPress‚Äôs content management capabilities allow working at scale and across teams. Central to this is the introduction of Block Bindings, which merge the flexibility of blocks with the structured power of meta fields. This feature allows block attributes to be directly linked to data sources like post meta, reducing the need for custom blocks while creating deeper, more dynamic content relationships. The familiar block interface remains intact, making complex data management feel seamless. This connects naturally with our broader work on Data Views for post types and meta fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These updates reinforce WordPress‚Äôs role as a powerful content management system by connecting its core primitives‚Äîblocks, post types, taxonomies, and meta fields‚Äîmore intuitively.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Development</h3>



<p>Lastly, Mat√≠as showcased a range of groundbreaking tools that empower WordPress developers and streamline their workflows. One of the highlights was the new Templates API, which has simplified the process of registering and managing custom templates. Future updates to the API will allow users to register and activate templates seamlessly, enabling dynamic site customizations such as scheduling different homepage templates for special events or swapping category archives during campaigns. This flexible approach offers developers greater creative control in a standardized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The session also explored the Interactivity API, designed to deliver fast, seamless website experiences by enabling server-rendered interactivity within WordPress. Unlike JavaScript-heavy frameworks, this technology keeps everything within WordPress‚Äôs existing ecosystem, bridging the gap between developers and content creators. Attendees saw live demos showcasing instant search, pagination, and commenting‚Äîall without page reloads‚Äîwhile maintaining a perfect performance score of 100 on Lighthouse. In addition, it was announced that responsive controls will receive significant attention, with new features being explored, like block visibility by breakpoint and adding min/max controls to the columns block.</p>



<p>The WordPress Playground also emerged as a game-changer, allowing users to spin up WordPress sites directly in their browsers, experiment with Blueprints, and manage projects offline. With improved GitHub integration and expanded documentation, WordPress developers now have a more accessible and powerful toolkit than ever before.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An AI Future</h2>



<p>Returning to the stage, Matt noted that Gutenberg‚Äôs evolution is paving the way for AI-powered site building while keeping creative control in users‚Äô hands. A recent speed building challenge on WordPress‚Äôs YouTube channel showcased this potential, with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ndiego/">Nick Diego</a> using AI-assisted tools and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/welcher/">Ryan Welcher</a> building manually. While the AI-assisted approach won, the key takeaway was that AI isn‚Äôt here to replace developers but to enhance creativity and efficiency.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Community Impact and Global Reach</h2>



<p>When WordPress Executive Director Mary Hubbard took the stage, she emphasized WordPress‚Äôs commitment to its open-source mission and the power of its global community. Mary shared her passion for defending WordPress‚Äôs principles, reaffirming that when users choose WordPress, they should receive the authentic, community-driven experience that the platform stands for. This commitment to clarity, trust, and open-source integrity is central to ensuring WordPress‚Äôs long-term sustainability and success.</p>

<p>In 2024, WordPress‚Äôs global influence surged through expanded educational programs, developer contributions, and grassroots initiatives. The platform‚Äôs social media following grew to 2.3 million, while major events like WordCamps and live-streamed gatherings attracted millions of attendees and viewers, connecting people worldwide.</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.wordpress.org/">Learn WordPress</a> introduced Structured Learning Pathways, offering tailored tracks for beginners and developers, fostering a growing network of creators eager to learn and contribute. Grassroots programs flourished, with WP Campus Connect bringing WordPress education to Indian colleges and innovation competitions in Uganda empowering young creators. In Latin America, the Community Reactivation Project reignited meetups across nine cities, fostering a network of over 150 active members and setting the stage for three new WordCamps in 2025.</p>



<p>WordPress‚Äôs efforts also advanced through <a href="https://openverse.org/">Openverse</a>, which expanded its free content library to 884 million images and 4.2 million audio files, serving millions of creators worldwide and supporting WordPress‚Äôs broader mission of democratizing publishing.</p>



<p>Whether through educational platforms, developer-driven innovation, or community-led projects, WordPress‚Äôs ecosystem continues to nurture shared learning, creativity, and collaboration, ensuring its growth and relevance for future generations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Japanese Community Highlights</h2>



<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/nukaga/">Junko Fukui Nukaga</a>‚ÄîCommunity Team rep, program manager, and WordCamp organizer‚Äînoted that WordPress&#8217;s prominence in Japan contributes to an economy now estimated to exceed 100 billion yen.</p>



<p>In October of 2024, the Japanese WordPress community celebrated DigitalCube‚Äôs IPO on the Tokyo PRO Market, marking a milestone for the local WordPress ecosystem. Major contributors like Takayuki Miyoshi‚Äôs <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/">Contact Form 7</a> plugin surpassed 10 million active users, while companies like Sakura Internet and XServer built specialized WordPress infrastructure.</p>



<p>Community events in Japan have also flourished, with 189 local meetups held throughout the year, fueled by dedicated volunteers and organizers. Translation Night gatherings have ensured WordPress remains accessible to Japanese users, reflecting a thriving collaborative spirit.</p>



<p>Matt gave special recognition to Japan‚Äôs standout contributor, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/wildworks/">Aki Hamano</a>, a Core Committer whose exceptional efforts elevated WordPress development over the past year. Hamano-san made an impressive 774 contributions to WordPress core, earning 162 props for WordPress 6.5, rising to 274 props for 6.6 as the second-highest contributor, and securing the top spot with 338 props for 6.7.Other notable Japanese contributors included <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/atachibana/">Akira Tachibana</a>, an active Docs Team member, and Nukaga, recognized for her exceptional community organizing efforts. Additionally, 13 Japanese contributors supported 5.4% of WordPress 6.6 development, showcasing the country‚Äôs growing influence in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data Liberation</h2>



<p>Reflecting on the progress since the initiative&#8217;s launch last year, the focus remained on ensuring that WordPress not only becomes more powerful but also embodies freedom in its deepest sense‚Äîthe freedom to move content anywhere, collaborate without limits, and create without constraints. This vision extends beyond individual sites to a broader web where content flows seamlessly across platforms, enabling unrestricted creativity and innovation.</p>



<p>One compelling example demonstrated how easily ePub files could be imported into a WordPress site, integrating seamlessly with existing designs. This represents the initiative‚Äôs broader goal: making content migration and integration effortless. WordPress Playground plays a critical role in this vision by enabling easy site migration through a simple browser extension. With Playground as a staging area, migrating and adapting sites becomes intuitive and accessible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Q&amp;A</h2>



<p>The floor was opened to questions in both Japanese and English.</p>

<p>The Block Editor contains so many features I miss when writing in other editors. It produces clean, semantic markup. You can paste in content from anywhere and the editor will clean it up for you, or paste a link onto selected text to auto-link. The List View and Outline panels allow you to easily navigate and inspect the content. And we‚Äôre constantly iterating on the Block Editor: more features and improvements are on the way, such as refined drag and drop interactions coming in early 2025.</p>



<p>All this inspired me to wrap our editor in an app that can read and write local files‚Äîjust as other document editors do. It turns out that EPUB is the best file format to store the content, because EPUB is an open standard for e-books that is essentially a ZIP file containing HTML and media‚ÄîHTML like your WordPress posts!</p>

<p>And just like that, the WordPress Block Editor can also be used to write books! The cool thing about EPUB files is that any e-book app, such as Kindle and Apple Books, can open it. So even if someone doesn‚Äôt have this editor, they can still easily read the content, which makes the files it produces portable.</p>



<p>The editor allows you to create a cover, so you can easily distinguish between the books or documents you write. It will also treat each heading as a chapter so you can easily navigate content when opened in an e-book reader.</p>

<p>The term ‚Äúbook‚Äù should be taken broadly. While the file that the Block Editor produces is primarily used for e-books, you can create any document with it. It‚Äôs possible to export your document to a DOCX file in case you need it, though the more complex blocks are not supported yet.</p>



<p>It is still very much a nascent project. There‚Äôs many features left to be added, such as revisions and the ability to open any externally created EPUB files, or even DOCX files, so keep an eye out for these in the coming weeks and months! If you‚Äôre interested in this editor, it‚Äôs all <a href="https://github.com/block-editors/blockdocs">open source</a>, and I welcome any kind of help.</p>



<p>For now, the <a href="https://block-editors.github.io/blockdocs/">demo editor</a> is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) in Chrome. While it‚Äôs totally usable without installation, it does give you some nice benefits such as allowing you to open the EPUB files directly from your OS. In the future we might wrap it in proper native apps. Your feedback is welcome on <a href="https://github.com/block-editors/blockdocs">GitHub</a>!</p>

<p>Each WordPress release celebrates an artist who has made an indelible mark on the world of music. WordPress 6.7, code-named &#8220;Rollins,&#8221; pays tribute to the legendary jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. Known as one of the greatest improvisers and pioneers in jazz, Rollins has influenced generations of musicians with his technical brilliance, innovative spirit, and fearless approach to musical expression.</p>



<p>Sonny Rollins&#8217; work is characterized by its unmatched energy and emotional depth. His compositions, such as &#8220;St. Thomas,&#8221; &#8220;Oleo,&#8221; and &#8220;Airegin,&#8221; are timeless jazz standards, celebrated for their rhythmic complexity and melodic inventiveness. Rollins&#8217; bold and exploratory style resonates with WordPress&#8217; own commitment to empowering creators to push boundaries and explore new possibilities in digital expression.</p>



<p>Embrace the spirit of innovation and spontaneity that defines Rollins&#8217; sound as you dive into the new features and enhancements of WordPress 6.7.</p>
