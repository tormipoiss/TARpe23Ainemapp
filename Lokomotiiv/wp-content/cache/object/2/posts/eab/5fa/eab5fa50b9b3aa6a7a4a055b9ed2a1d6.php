<p>Lokomotiiv Catering was born from a shared dream and passionate discussion. Our story began many years ago when friends and I discussed how we could turn our love for food into something more. Each of us had different experiences and skills, which seemed like the perfect combination to start our own business.</p>

<p>Our goal was to create something unique that would bring together quality food and an authentic experience. We were inspired by trains and their ability to connect people and cultures. That‚Äôs how the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãLokomotiiv Catering was born, offering culinary experiences as if you were traveling to different destinations.</p>

<p>We started small, organizing pop-up dinners and food festivals, and receiving feedback that inspired and guided us forward. Our menus are designed around seasonal and locally sourced ingredients, highlighting a diverse food culture.</p>
